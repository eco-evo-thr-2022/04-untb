# Discussion points from the issues

- What if local community and metacommunity are different? e.g., local purturbation to local community
- Points that refute with UNTB?
    - r vs K selected species?
    - clear differences in dispersal ability?
    - climate change?
- What about initial conditions?
    - Is the mono-culture initial condition realistic?
    - What about if the local community starts with higher diversity than would be supported by immigration/speciation?
- What is the timescale/spatial scale of UNTB?  Does predictive power vary across scales?  Do predictions vary?
- How do we extend this model past neutrality?
- Could we use this approach for other observables? e.g.:
    - phenotypes?
    - single population dynamics?
    - population genetics?
